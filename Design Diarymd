## Project: Python Scripting

### Topic: Challenges in the project
For starters, getting inspiration on this project was one of the biggest issues. I spent a good chunk of stress and mental energy just trying to motivate myself to pursue a project. Once my project was decided on, the next biggest challenges were to relearn how to make trees and put myself into a 3d coordinate and graphics mindset for the Unity-driven graphics display I implemented for the project. On the scripting side of things, building a clean recursive function was fun and a bit of a challenge. On the Unity side of things, I had to relearn some 3d math and graphing manipulations and build point-to-point object instantiation in Unity.

### Topic: Fun aspects
I love making recursive functions. It's so pretty, programmatically, in my opinion. It was amazing to see the visual representations of these directories, so the end product was awesome. It was something I was very interested in, and I may reuse some of this code for future 3d representations of data.

### Topic: For the future of this assignment
For future students, I highly recommend doing something you're passionate about. This project wouldn't have been close to being finished in a timely manner had I not been interested in it. Although the script is relatively small, it packs a big punch, and I feel like that's something future students need to focus on: Make something that does a lot in a small package. I'd love to see someone condense all my code down into something super small and simple. For the future of this assignment, I love the creativity and openess of it, and would love to see all the things people have made. Although you are having a demo day, I don't know if this is planned or not prior to the project being assigned, but I'd like to imagine you've planned it from the start for us to showcase. I'm very excited to see what people have made, especially after hearing from one of my buddies.

### Topic: Future of this project
I want to implement this script to read websites in the same manner that it does my file folders. I'd love to see some smaller websites portrayed the way they are. I'd like to add the ability to generate pictures over time in Unity so I can see the growth of a system while running the script every day. My next project for this class, I'll be running this script every 15 minutes to build a fun little tree.
